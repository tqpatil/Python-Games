# file: hangman.py is a program that allows a user to play the classic game
# "hangman" in command line. It first selects a word based on user input for word size
# and lets the user choose how many lives they will have. The program will
# then print out the game line by line until its end, which will ask the user
# if they want to play again. 
# input: User input of both integers and strings. When setting the word size and number of lives, the input should be integers from 3-12 and
# 1-10. If the user chooses the default, word size will be any size, and number of lives will be 5.
# During the game, the user will input letters, one by one, until they either spell out the letter or fail the game.
# output: "Something went wrong" when encountering an exception and game interface output. When the user sets the wrod size and number of lives, the output will repeat their inputs to the user
# to verify them. During the game, the program will repeatedly output the number of letters(denoted by a '_'), the number of lives
# , and the letters that have already been chosen

alphabet= "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz"
banned=[""," "]
# write all your functions here

# make a dictionary from a dictionary file ('dictionary.txt', see above)
# dictionary keys are word sizes (1, 2, 3, 4, â€¦, 12), and values are lists of words
# for example, dictionary = { 2 : ['Ms', 'ad'], 3 : ['cat', 'dog', 'sun'] }
# if a word has the size more than 12 letters, put it into the list with the key equal to 12
